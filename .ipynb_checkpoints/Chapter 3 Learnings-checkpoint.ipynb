An array contains parts that are called as the element and the index. And element is an item that is stored inside an array wherein an index is the position or location of each element in an array.  An index determines the location of all the elements in an array so it can be used to access elements. The index number only limit until 10 indexes wherein the first element has an index of 0 and the last element has an index of 9.\n",

Type codes are the codes defines what type of elements an array will holds. Another thing that I learned is how to start an array.\n"
